# Winterspring Launcher
Allows you to play on [Everlook.org](https://everlook.org/) with modern 1.14 WoW Client!  
_This is not an official project from the Everlook team._  
_Do not ask the Everlook team for support_  
_(you can still ask in [#addons-and-ui](https://discord.com/channels/973529971740008448/983067524797177996) on Discord)_ 

## Easy setup
The launcher will do everything for you.  
It will download the 1.14 client, setup HermesProxy and launch the game.  
When HermesProxy has an update it is automatically applied.

You can download older versions from CurseForge under the "Files" tab. ([Example](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A9094))

## Why?
The modern WoW-Classic client provides many improvements in hardware compatibility and accessibility.

With Everlook we have the unique chance to improve HermesProxy with a large testing audience.   
The launcher will make the classic client accessible to everyone.  
So if you find any bugs [please report them](https://github.com/WowLegacyCore/HermesProxy/issues/new/choose).  
(If you find any bugs associated to the launcher report them [here](https://github.com/0blu/WinterspringLauncher/issues))

## Is this allowed?
Currently HermesProxy is tolerated on Everlook.  
⚠️You **will** get suspended if you exploit any game breaking bugs.  
So far no-one has been banned for using official HermesProxy.  
Just use common sense and <u>**play fair**</u>!

# Many thanks to
